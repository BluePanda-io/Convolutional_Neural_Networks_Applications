# Convolutional Neural Networks Applications

Two applications of Convolutional Deep Neural Networks that I built during a CNN specialization - Originally developed 22/05/2019

You can find everything on the two JupyterNotebooks"

## What was developed in this project
These applications were my favorite part of the course, teaching me how to use frameworks to create real world projects using Deep Learning.
